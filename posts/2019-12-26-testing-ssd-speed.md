# Testing M2 SSD drives

I just received 1Tb Crucial SSD M.2 NVMe drive that I bought with a good discount.
My laptop LG Gram 17 supports two NVMe drives and has two 2280 slots, therefore it was easy for
me to decide what machine will use this drive.

FInally, I end up with this configuration:
* Samsung SSD 970 EVO 1TB 
* Crucial P1 SSD 1TB CT1000P1SSD8

They both has the same size 1TB, but Samsung is 1.5 times more expensive than Crucial.

So, I decided to do benchmark for both of them.

The first difference that I found is the temperature. 
Samsung is 51C, whereas Crucial just only 40C.

Second thing is performance. Samsung drive is almost 2x faster than Crucial on reads. And I can feel it by running games.

Samsung results:

Crucial results:

For my humble opinion, if you going to build a gaming computer, or ML computer or HPC computer go forward with Samsung drives.
EVO 970 is a good choice, or even take a look on EVO Pro. 

It cost that money.
